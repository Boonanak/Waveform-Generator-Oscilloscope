# Using the Cursors on an Oscilloscope

## Overview
Cursors on an oscilloscope allow for manual measurements of waveform properties, providing a more flexible way to analyze signals compared to automatic measurements. By placing cursors at specific points, users can determine voltage levels, time intervals, and frequency directly from the display.

## Types of Cursors

### **1. Time (Horizontal) Cursors**
- Measure time differences between two points on a waveform.
- Useful for determining **period, frequency, and phase differences**.

### **2. Voltage (Vertical) Cursors**
- Measure voltage differences at specific points.
- Useful for finding **peak voltage, amplitude, and offset**.

### **3. Paired (Both Time & Voltage) Cursors**
- Used together to measure both time and voltage differences.
- Helps analyze **signal rise time, fall time, and waveform slopes**.

## How to Use the Cursors

### **Step 1: Activate the Cursor Menu**
- Press the **Cursors** button on the oscilloscope.
- Select the type of cursor measurement (Time, Voltage, or Both).

### **Step 2: Position the Cursors**
- Use the control knobs to move the cursors to desired points on the waveform.
- The oscilloscope will display real-time numerical values corresponding to the cursor positions.

### **Step 3: Interpret the Measurements**
- **ΔT (Time Difference):** Used to determine signal period or frequency.
- **ΔV (Voltage Difference):** Used to find voltage swing or amplitude.
- **Slope:** Indicates the rate of change in voltage over time.

### **Step 4: Remove or Adjust Cursors**
- Adjust cursor positions as needed for different measurements.
- Exit the cursor mode when done to clear the display.

## Best Practices
- **Use Cursors for Precision:** Ideal when automatic measurements are insufficient or unavailable.
- **Combine with Triggering:** Helps analyze specific parts of a waveform with stability.
- **Measure Noise and Jitter:** Cursors can be used to analyze small fluctuations in signals.
- **Compare Multiple Waveforms:** Use cursors across different channels to examine phase shifts or signal correlations.
