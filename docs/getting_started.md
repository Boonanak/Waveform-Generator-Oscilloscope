### 1. Waveform Selection 
- Most waveform generators have buttons, dials, or a touch screen to select the type of waveform.  
- **Common options:** Sine, Square, Triangle, Noise.  

### 2. Frequency Control 
- Typically adjusted with a knob, keypad, or menu.

### 3. Amplitude and Offset  
- **Amplitude:** Controls the peak-to-peak voltage.  
- **Offset:** Adds a constant DC voltage to shift the waveform.  

### 4. Output Enable
- A button to turn the signal output on or off.  
- Always ensure the output is enabled before expecting a signal.  

### 5. Modulation Inputs 
- For external modulation, use the modulation input port to connect another signal source.  

### 6. Display  
- **Waveform Generator:** Shows settings like waveform type, frequency, amplitude, and offset.   

### 7. Output & Input Ports  
- **Main Output:** The port (usually a BNC connector) where the signal is delivered.  
- **Auxiliary Ports:** For synchronization, triggering, or external modulation.

### **1. Entry Knob**  
- Used for fine-tuning settings and navigating menus.  
- Can be used to:  
  - Adjust parameter values such as frequency, amplitude, or trigger level.  
  - Move cursors for precise measurements.  
  - Scroll through menus and select options.  
- Often works in conjunction with soft keys or touchscreen inputs.  

### **2. Input Channels**  
- Oscilloscopes typically have multiple input channels (e.g., CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4).  
- Each channel has a **BNC connector** where probes attach to measure signals.  
- Channels can be enabled or disabled independently.  

### **3. Vertical Controls (Amplitude Adjustment)**  
- **Volts/Div Knob:** Adjusts the vertical scaling (amplitude) of the waveform.  
- **Position Knob:** Moves the waveform up or down for better visibility.  
- **Channel Selection:** Enables/disables individual input channels.  

### **4. Horizontal Controls (Time Base Adjustment)**  
- **Time/Div Knob:** Adjusts how much time each horizontal division represents, effectively zooming in or out on the waveform.  
- **Position Knob:** Moves the waveform left or right to align with the grid.  

### **5. Trigger Controls**  
- **Trigger Level:** Sets the voltage level at which the oscilloscope captures and stabilizes the waveform.  
- **Trigger Mode:** Options like Auto, Normal, and Single determine how the oscilloscope captures signals.  
- **Trigger Source:** Selects which input channel or external source is used for triggering.  

### **6. Display**  
- Shows real-time waveform data, including voltage, time, and frequency measurements.  
- Many oscilloscopes include grid overlays, cursors, and measurement readouts.  

### **7. Math and FFT Functions**  
- **Math Button:** Allows mathematical operations between signals, such as:  
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of two waveforms.  
  - Custom waveform processing like filtering.  
- **FFT Button:** Converts the time-domain signal into a frequency-domain representation, useful for spectral analysis.  

### **8. Analyze Button**  
- Provides in-depth waveform analysis, including:  
  - **Power analysis**
  - **Harmonic distortion analysis** for AC signals.  
  - **Custom measurement setups** to extract key waveform characteristics.  

### **9. Cursor Button**  
- Activates **manual measurement cursors**, allowing you to place markers on the waveform to measure:  
  - **Time differences (ΔT)** between two points.  
  - **Voltage differences (ΔV)** between two points.  
  - **Frequency calculations** based on ΔT.  
- Cursors can be freely moved using the **Entry Knob** or dedicated navigation buttons.  

### **10. Measure Button**  
- Automatically calculates and displays common waveform parameters such as:  
  - **Frequency**  
  - **Period**  
  - **Peak-to-peak voltage (Vpp)**  
  - **RMS voltage (Vrms)**  
  - **Duty cycle**  
- The DSOX1204G allows for multiple simultaneous measurements on different waveforms.  

### **11. Input & External Ports**  
- **BNC Inputs (CH1, CH2, etc.):** Main signal input ports for probes.  
- **Trigger Input:** Used for external triggering to sync signals.  
- **USB/LAN Ports:** Allow data transfer, remote control, or saving screenshots.

# Getting Started with a Waveform Generator and Oscilloscope  

## Steps to Begin  

### **1. Power On the Devices**  
- Turn on both the waveform generator and oscilloscope.  
- Wait for initialization to complete.  

### **2. Connect the Devices**  
- Use a **BNC-to-BNC cable** to connect the waveform generator’s output to the oscilloscope’s input channel (e.g., CH1).  
- Or use a **BNC-to-probe cable** if connecting to a circuit.  

### **3. Configure the Waveform Generator**  
- **Select Waveform:** Use the front panel controls to choose the desired waveform (e.g., sine wave).  
- **Set Parameters:**  
  - **Frequency:** Set the oscillation rate (e.g., 1 kHz).  
  - **Amplitude:** Adjust the voltage level (e.g., 2 Vpp).  
  - **Offset:** Add DC offset if needed (e.g., 1 V).  
- **Enable Output:** Press the "Output Enable" button to start generating the waveform.  

### **4. Set Up the Oscilloscope**  
- **Choose the Correct Input Channel:** Ensure the signal is connected to the right channel (e.g., CH1).  
- **Adjust Vertical Scale (Voltage per Division):** Set an appropriate scale to clearly see the waveform.  
- **Adjust Horizontal Scale (Time per Division):** Set a time base that provides a stable view of the waveform.  
- **Set Triggering:** Use edge triggering on the correct channel to stabilize the waveform display.  

### **5. Observe and Analyze the Signal**  
- Use the oscilloscope display to verify that the waveform matches the expected signal.  
- Adjust scaling and triggering for optimal visualization.  
- Use built-in measurement tools to analyze frequency, amplitude, and other properties.

# Best Practices  

### **For Waveform Generators:**  
- **Start Low:** Begin with a low amplitude to avoid damaging connected devices.  
- **Verify Connections:** Double-check all cable connections before powering up.  
- **Use Proper Termination:** Ensure the generator's output impedance matches the load (typically 50 ohms).  
- **Turn Off Output When Not in Use:** Disable the output when changing settings to avoid unintentional signals.  

### **For Oscilloscopes:**  
- **Use Proper Probing Techniques:** Use 10x attenuation probes for high-frequency signals to reduce loading effects.  
- **Set the Ground Properly:** Connect the probe ground clip to a common ground in the circuit.  
- **Adjust Bandwidth Limit (if available):** Use the bandwidth limit setting to filter out high-frequency noise when necessary.  
- **Save Data for Analysis:** Utilize screenshot and data export functions for documentation.
