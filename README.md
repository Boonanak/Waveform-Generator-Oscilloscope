# Waveform Generator

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to using a bench waveform generator and how to use an Oscilloscope for various applications. Learn how to generate and configure waveforms, connect to other devices, visualize waveforms, and measure them.

A waveform generator is an electronic device or software tool used to create electrical waveforms, which are repetitive signals that vary over time. These signals can take different shapes, such as sine waves, square waves, triangular waves, or sawtooth waves. Waveform generators are essential in testing and designing circuits, systems, and equipment across various fields such as telecommunications, audio engineering, and physics.

An oscilloscope is a device used to visualize waveforms, measure their characteristics, and compare them to others. It functions similarly to a multimeter but is specifically designed for AC analysis. Oscilloscopes are commonly used in circuit analysis, such as determining a system's transfer function, as well as for debugging applications. They offer various signal analysis options and allow users to set specific measurements to determine attributes like amplitude and phase shift, (as well as countless more). Additionally, manual analysis can be performed using adjustable cursors.
